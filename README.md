# Casino!
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bmangelsen/casino.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bmangelsen/casino)

This project represents the culmination of my learning from the backend course I took at The Iron Yard in Washington, DC. Early in my course we completed console line blackjack, which got me interested in programming game logic. For this project I took that idea and ran with it to create this Rails application. Currently blackjack is available to play, and in my next sprint I plan to add additional games to the application library.

## Installation & Usage
This application is currently live at the following url:
https://casino-application.herokuapp.com/

To run this application locally, simply:

`````
$ bundle
`````

followed by:

`````
$ rails s
`````

## Testing
This project uses [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) and [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara), so please read up on the documentation and dependencies for testing (especially in conjunction with the [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) gem)!
